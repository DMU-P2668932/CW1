<p class="synopsis">The film Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop/comedy film, starring actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and was
directed by Edgar Wright. The film is a part of the 'Cornetto Trilogy', which also includes the films Shaun of the Dead
and The Worlds End, all of which include the three men. The plot follows Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a Metropolitan Police
Sergeant who has been transferred to the seemingly quiet town of Sanford. While initially it seems like it would be a lot
easier than back in London, but soon after, some people living in the village mysteriously start dying. Initially, they all
seem like unfortunate accidents, however Sergeant Angel notices that there's suspicious about all of the 'accidents'. Since the rest
of Sanford's Police force are still oblivious to the true nature of what's happening, Sergeant Angel has to investigate alone,
being dubbed a Madman by the Police Chief of Sanford. As Angel continues to dig in to the possible reasons as to why the deaths
are happening, a passing remark from a shopworker ends up lettimg him know what's truly happening, and try to put it to a stop.</p>
