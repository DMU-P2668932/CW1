<p class="description">Seargent Angel is the binary opposite of your average action hero, almost never
questioning the authority of those above him, and doing literally everything to the letter, to the point
of his girlfriend breaking off their relationship, as he can 'never turn off', and he's 'more in love with the job.'
All of these aspects made it even more of a surprise for Angel when he was told by several of his superios that he was
being transferred, as he was "making everyone else look bad". Therefore, he gets shipped off to the south with nothing
but his clothes, his badgeand his houseplant. After a rough start, kicking out the whole bar for having underage drinkers,
this set the town's first impression of him. The idea of him being a rigourous rule followe is further shown when he
unknowingly places his new partner, Danny Butterman, under arrest, showing that the whole townhas an attitude of letting
people do as they want 'for the greater good'. But as people living in the villagemysteriously starting appearing dead,
it's up to Seargent Angel to attempt to get the Sanford Police Forceto stop loafing around, and attempt to stop the murders.
But, when it seems like Angel has managed to corner who he percieves to be the killer, all evidence has seemed to vanished.

<p class="description">Being a local of Sanford, Danny has had a perculiar work life, in comparison to the average
police officer. The towns view of 'for the greater good' means actually arrestable crimes, like underage drinking, are
pushed under the rug, as it keeps the kids out of possibly further trouble. This means that the police end up being called
out to sort things like an escaped swan. Back at the station, the officers are mainly sitting there and eating ice-cream instead
of sorting out the paperwork of the callouts. Once Seargent Angel arrives, Danny first meets him when he stumbles out of the pub
drunk, then almost hits him with his car. Thiis is when both Seargent Angel and the audience find out that Danny is the Chief's son,
and he'll be getting paired up with Angel. This starts the friendship between the two, with Angel's professionalism helping Danny to
be a better officer, and Danny helping Angel to realise that his job shouldn't take up his whole life, and to live a little. Towards the
climax of the film, it seems like he is a part of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance, now a cult that is killing off any 'undesirables'
ahead of the Village of the Year competition, but this turned out to be a ploy, as the two of them arm themselves with the confiscated
guns seen earlier, and go to take down the NWA.</p>
